'''
Mark a problem as reviewed. Updates last_solved to today and sets revisit_in_days.

Usage:
    sensei mark 217
    sensei mark contains-duplicate
    sensei mark "valid anagram"
    sensei mark 217 --rating g          (non-interactive)
    sensei mark 217 --rating g --no-spread  (disable load smoothing)
